# ALGORITHM
> In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks. [Wiki][1]  

Although I have finished so many quizzes, algorithm were still, for a long time, something my brain regard as meaningless - there are so many existing package or build-in function, how do we need that? But now I change my mind as learning in-depth. Maybe the importance is not algorithm itself, but the abstract thinking. We have to build up connection between a problem and what kinds of model we have learnt. It make us think like a machine without any emotion.  
  
Anyway, it really help me a lot to find a good job.

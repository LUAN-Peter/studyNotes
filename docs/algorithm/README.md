# ALGORITHM

> In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks. [Wiki][1]  

Although I have finished so many quizzes, algorithms were still, for a long time, something my brain regard as meaningless - there are so many existing package or build-in function, how do we need that? But now, I change my mind about learning in-depth. Maybe the importance is not the algorithm itself but the abstract thinking. We have to build up the connection between a problem and the model we have learned. It makes us think like a machine without any emotion.  

Anyway, it helps me a lot to find a good job.

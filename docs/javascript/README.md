> JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object orientation, and first-class functions.    
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use their client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device. [Wiki][1]

There is a joke saying, Brendan Eich drove and met a crossroad suddenly. There were two signs with `Lisp` on the left and `Java` on the right. Brendan Eich thought for a moment and aimed the front of the car to the middle of two signs. Kicked down with all his strenth. But who cares about it? It is was created with low expectations and intended to be a sidekick to Java within browser, just more suitable to a beginner and part-time programmers. At the same time It is so prevalent around the Web world. In addition to server applications, JavaScript is being used to build desktop application and robots. Since you could not escape it, join it!  
I've told the interviewer or so that I was familiar with JS. But I haven't even done a knowledge organization). Sound funny. Hmm...

# JavaScript

> JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.  
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device. [Wiki][1]

JavaScript is jokingly called a language designed by Brendan Eich while he is shitting. I donnot think so though there are so many weird(or unreasonable) stuff when I was a beginner. Who cares about it, it is so pervalent around the Web world. Since you could not escape it, just join it!  
I've told to the interviewer or so that I was familiar with JS. But I haven't even do a KO(Knowledge Organization). Sound funny Hmm...

> JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object orientation, and first-class functions.    
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use their client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device. [Wiki][1]

JavaScript is jokingly called a language designed by Brendan Eich while he is shitting. I don't think so though there was so much weird(or unreasonable) stuff when I was a beginner. Who cares about it? It is so prevalent around the Web world. Since you could not escape it, join it!  
I've told the interviewer or so that I was familiar with JS. But I haven't even done a knowledge organization). Sound funny. Hmm...
